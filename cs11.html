<P style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;color: white;">A CSS (cascading style sheet) file allows you to separate your web sites (X)HTML content from it’s style. As always you use your (X)HTML file to arrange the content, but all of the presentation (fonts, colors, background, borders, text formatting, link effects & so on…) are accomplished within a CSS.

        At this point you have some choices of how to use the CSS, either internally or externally.
        
        
        Internal Stylesheet
        First we will explore the internal method. This way you are simply placing the CSS code within the  tags of each (X)HTML file you want to style with the CSS. The format for this is shown in the example below.
        
        With this method each (X)HTML file contains the CSS code needed to style the page. Meaning that any changes you want to make to one page, will have to be made to all. This method can be good if you need to style only one page, or if you want different pages to have varying styles.
        
        Cascading Order
        In the previous paragraphs, I have explained how to link to a css file either internally or externally. If you understood, than I am doing a good job. If not don’t fret, there is a long way to go before we are finished. Assuming you have caught on already, you are probably asking, well can I do both? The answer is yes. You can have both internal, external, and now wait a minute a third way? Yes inline styles also.
        
        
        Inline Styles
        I have not mentioned them until now because in a way they defeat the purpose of using CSS in the first place. Inline styles are defined right in the (X)HTML file along side the element you want to style. See example below.</p>
