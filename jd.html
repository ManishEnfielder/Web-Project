<P style=" font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;color: white;">Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for the development of software for consumer electronic devices, such as TVs, VCRs, toasters, etc.

        Java is a platform neutral language, which means that it is not tied to any particular hardware or operating system. It guarantees users to ‘write once, run anywhere.' The Java language is supported by almost every operating system, such as Sun Solaris, RedHat, Windows, etc.
        The Java programming language was developed by Sun Microsystems of the USA in 1991, it was originally called Oak by James Gosling, who was one of the inventors of the language. The main goal for the developers was to make the language highly reliable, portable and simple.

        The team for the development of Java language included Patrick Naughton, who discovered that the existing languages such as C and C++ had some major drawbacks in terms of reliability and portability. They modeled the new language Java on C and C++, while removing some features that they considered constraints. This made Java a really simple, portable, and powerful language. To learn Java basics, let’s revise the Java syntax.</p>
